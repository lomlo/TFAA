#### Makers Academy final project
For the culmination of the 12 week coding bootcamp, I participated in a small group to design a choose your own adventure game. The highlight was the dynamic tree diagram that generated upon creation of a new adventure, displaying chapters and associated choices.
###### Ruby on Rails, HTML and CSS, testing in RSpec and Capybara, postgres for databases.
